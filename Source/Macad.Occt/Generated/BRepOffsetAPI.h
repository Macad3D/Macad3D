/// An evolved shape is built from a planar spine (face or

/// Self-intersections are removed.
/// A MakeEvolved object provides a framework for:
/// - defining the construction of an evolved shape,
/// - implementing the construction algorithm, and
/// - consulting the result.
/// Computes an Evolved by
/// 1 - sweeping a profile along a spine.
/// 2 - removing the self-intersections.
/// 
/// The Profile is expected to be planar and can be a line
/// (which lies in infinite number of planes).
/// 
/// The profile is defined in a Referential R. The position of
/// the profile at the current point of the  spine is given by
/// confusing R  and the local  referential given by (  D0, D1
/// and the normal of the Spine).
/// 
/// The coordinate system is determined by theIsAxeProf argument:
/// - if theIsAxeProf is true, R is the global coordinate system,
/// - if theIsAxeProf is false, R is computed so that:
/// * its origin is given by the point on the spine which is
/// closest to the profile,
/// * its "X Axis" is given by the tangent to the spine at this point, and
/// * its "Z Axis" is the normal to the plane which contains the spine.
/// 
/// theJoinType defines the type of pipe generated by the salient
/// vertices of the spine. The default type is GeomAbs_Arc
/// where the vertices generate revolved pipes about the
/// axis passing along the vertex and the normal to the
/// plane of the spine. At present, this is the only
/// construction type implemented.
/// 
/// if <theIsSolid> is TRUE the Shape result is completed to be a
/// solid or a compound of solids.
/// 
/// If theIsProfOnSpine == TRUE then the profile must connect with the spine.

/// in the result of Pipe-algorithm will be removed by
/// BOPAlgo_MakerVolume algorithm. At that the arguments
/// "theJoinType", "theIsAxeProf", "theIsProfOnSpine" are not used.
