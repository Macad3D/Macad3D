/// The Enumeration describes an additional option for the algorithms
/// in the Boolean Component such as General Fuse, Boolean operations,
/// Section, Maker Volume, Splitter and Cells Builder algorithms.<br>
/// 
/// The Gluing options have been designed to speed up the computation
/// of the interference among arguments of the operations on special cases,
/// in which the arguments may be overlapping but do not have real intersections
/// between their sub-shapes.<br>
/// 
/// This option cannot be used on the shapes having real intersections,
/// like intersection vertex between edges, or intersection vertex between
/// edge and a face or intersection line between faces.<br>
/// 
/// There are two possibilities of overlapping shapes:<br>
/// 1. The shapes can be partially coinciding - the faces do not have
/// intersection curves, but overlapping. The faces of such arguments will
/// be split during the operation;<br>
/// 2. The shapes can be fully coinciding - there should be no partial
/// overlapping of the faces, thus no intersection of type EDGE/FACE at all.
/// In such cases the faces will not be split during the operation.<br>
/// 
/// Even though there are no real intersections on such cases without Gluing options the algorithm
/// will still intersect the sub-shapes of the arguments with interfering bounding boxes.<br>
/// 
/// The performance improvement in gluing mode is achieved by excluding
/// the most time consuming computations according to the given Gluing parameter:<br>
/// 1. Computation of FACE/FACE intersections for partial coincidence;<br>
/// 2. And computation of VERTEX/FACE, EDGE/FACE and FACE/FACE intersections for full
/// coincidence.<br>
/// 
/// By setting the Gluing option for the operation user should guarantee
/// that the arguments are really coinciding. The algorithms do not check this itself.
/// Setting inappropriate option for the operation is likely to lead to incorrect result.<br>
/// 
/// There are following items in the enumeration:<br>
/// **BOPAlgo_GlueOff** - default value for the algorithms, Gluing is switched off;<br>
/// **BOPAlgo_GlueShift** - Glue option for shapes with partial coincidence;<br>
/// **BOPAlgo_GlueFull** - Glue option for shapes with full coincidence.
